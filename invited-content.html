	  <p>Doriana Medić is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Turin. 
		  Her research initially focused on the formal foundations of reversible concurrency and programming languages, 
		  and later expanded to workflow languages and their formalization. She currently works on workflow systems supporting 
		  hybrid execution across heterogeneous computing resources, including cloud, HPC, and quantum platforms. 
		  Her recent research addresses the integration of HPC workloads with quantum backends and the development of 
		  practical applications for emerging quantum technologies.</p>
