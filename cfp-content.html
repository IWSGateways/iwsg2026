        <p>Science Gateways or virtual research environments support scientists throughout the stages of the research cycle, 
            including data collection and annotation, processing and analysis of complex scientific data, 
            visualization and publication of research data. 
            They bridge community and domain-specific expertise with modern information technologies such as the Internet of Things, 
            Big Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, and hybrid Cloud and HPC environments. 
            Through collaborative work, scientists are able to tap the full potential of their scientific data. 
            Further, they facilitate the access to compute and storage resources improving science through the employment of reproducible workflows.</p>

        <p>We invite the submission of papers related to Science Gateways.
            Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                <ul>
                    <li>AI and ML for science gateways</li>
                    <li>Social research on science gateways</li>
                    <li>E-infrastructures hosting and supporting science gateways</li>
                    <li>Architectures, frameworks and technologies for Science Gateways</li>
                    <li>Science Gateways sustaining collaborative communities</li>
                    <li>Research data management and Big Data visual analytics through Science Gateways</li>
                    <li>Support for scalability and data-driven methods in Science Gateways</li>
                    <li>Improving the reproducibility of science in Science Gateways</li>
                    <li>Science Gateway usability, portals, workflows and tools</li>
                    <li>Software engineering approaches supporting scientific work</li>
                    <li>Aspects of Science Gateways, such as security and stability</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We particularly encourage submissions from application scientists and community members reporting their firsthand experiences with science gateways.
            There are three forms of presentation: </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                <ul>
                    <li>Talks</li>
                    <li>Lightning talks</li>
                    <li>Demonstrations</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Submission of a full paper may result in a talk, while submission of an abstract may result in a lightning talk or demonstration.
            Presenters of full papers will be allotted a 30-minutes time slot (25 min talk, 5 min questions) to provide a summary and update on their work.
            Meanwhile, presenters of abstracts will be given a 15-minutes (10 min talk, 5 min questions) time slot.</p>
        <p>All contributions will be subject to standard peer review for quality, relevance, and novelty, which will determine acceptance and the form of presentation.
            All submissions will be kept confidential prior to publication in the proceedings.
            <strong>Full papers must not exceed</strong> <strong>six A4 pages</strong> and must be written in clear and readable English.
            <strong>Abstracts must not exceed 500 words</strong> and may include a diagram. They should also be written in clear, readable English.
            Authors of abstracts should include the word “Abstract:” in the title.</p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Papers and abstracts will only be accepted electronically in PDF format and must be submitted through our
   <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=iwsg2026">EasyChair website</a></span>.
   Please find templates for papers and abstracts at <a href="IWSG2026.zip">IWSG Paper and Abstract Templates</a>.</span></p>

        <p>It is anticipated to publish accepted full papers at <a href="https://zenodo.org" target="_blank">Zenodo</a>.</p>
        <p>Accepted abstracts will be published online on the IWSG webpage.</p>

        <b><i>Please note that authors of excellent abstracts and papers will be invited to submit a extended and updated version of their paper for a special issue on science gateways.</i></b></p>
